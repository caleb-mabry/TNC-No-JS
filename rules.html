                    <div class="flip-card-back">
                        <p>Explicit conversation, content, links, and roleplay is prohibited in the server lobby. This
                            includes specific topics delving into and links to gore, pornagraphy, and scandalous
                            roleplay. This does NOT forbid the acknowledgement of sex/gore/ERP/etc existing, but rather
                            specific, explicit details under these umbrellas. If a topic steers in this direction, the
                            onus is on the user to divert to direct messaging, taking it further until reminded by a
                            moderator past a single warning will not be tolerated. Other, specific cases may apply at a
                            moderator's discretion. </p>
                        <p> As a rule of thumb for where "the line" is with potentially sensitive subjects, consider
                            where the Ace Attorney franchise lands on an ESRB/PEGI rating. New and old users alike can
                            expect themes of murder/violence present in an Ace Attorney themed setting, but these games
                            avoid most explicit material. The exception here is simple explatives, which may be avoided
                            in Ace Attorney, but will not be censored in this server outside of derrogatory language and
                            other slurs. </p>
                        <p> Please note these rules differ for cases and other roleplays/chats hosted in non-lobby
                            areas. Other such events and especially cases, being that they portray criminal trials, are
                            likely to feature explicit content like gore, or in some cases, sexual content in some
                            capacity, but there is a line that will be drawn at a mods discretion. If you even think you
                            are approaching a line with your case's content, you should have a moderator look it over.
                            In most cases, the worst result of this would be a request to lock the area when you run the
                            case. </p>
